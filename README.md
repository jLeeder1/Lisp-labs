# Lisp-labs
Functional programming labs for Artificial Intelligence using Lisp

A set of lab works for my Artificial Intelligence module. 

This is simple list processing functions, mainly using "dolist", "assoc", "memeber", "rest"

Lab 2 is the main lab in which I set up a very simple perceptron for machine learning
